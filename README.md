This Python script utilizes Support Vector Regression (SVR) to predict stock prices based on historical data. The script reads historical stock prices from a CSV file, processes the data, and uses three different kernels of SVR (linear, polynomial, and radial basis function) to model and predict future stock prices. The results are visualized using matplotlib, showcasing the fit of each model against the actual data.
